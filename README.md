# Reference Implementation for a Symbl.ai Enterprise Application

The goal of this repository is to provide both:

- an architecture for a highly scalable application with Enterprise class features used for Conversation Understanding
- a concrete example to be used as a Reference Implementation for the Architecture described above

## Characteristics of an Enterprise Conversation Application

What are some attributes of an Enterprise Application for Conversation Understanding? Here are some typical qualities that would probably fit this type of application:

- Scalable - all aspects of the application can be scaled out to accommodate more operational capacity (ie microservices)
- Highly Available - the application can absorb outages but still continue to function and be accessible to users
- Data Resiliency - data strategic to the operation of the application is accessible despite disruptions
- Data Recovery and Migration - Has the ability to withstand catastrophic failure and migrate data to other providers

In addition to the above characteristics, Enterprise-class features specifically a Conversation Analytics platform might also include but are not limited to:

- Real-Time Response - Able to react to new information as it's happening
- Historical Data - Conversation data is captured for purposes like dashboards, etc
- Data Aggregation - Has the ability to detect trends or patterns based on historical data over time
- Predictive Actions - Performing autonomous application driven actions based on data patterns discovered

## Generic Architecture Diagram

This is a high-level block diagram, that satisfies the above characteristics, for what the architecture of an Enterprise Conversation could look like...

Feature Benefits for this Enterprise Reference Architecture:

- Build applications with a historical conversation context
- Persist conversation insights (data ownership)
- Build scalable conversation applications
- Companyâ€™s business rules/logic pushed into backend server microservices
- Dashboards, dashboards, dashboards
- Historical data is air-gapped and can be backed up
- UI isolation. Change all aspects of UI frameworks without changing the code
- Also supports Asynchronous analysis of data

### Enterprise Reference Implementation

Given the architecture above, the code in this repository implements the following using the described software platform or components:

## How to Deploy this Enterprise Reference Implementation

TODO: Coming soon...
